You are given an input which was created from a binary tree using the following logic

Recurse(node)
{
	if(node == null)
	{
		print 'TERM'
		return ;
	}

	print (node.data)
	Recurse (node.left);
	Recurse (node.right);
}

Now, Find the width of the binary tree that passes through root.. 
Width is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree.

Example, 

            1
          /   \
        2      3
      /  \
    4     5
 
 Ans is 4. Note there are two longest paths passing through root, 4,2,1,3 and 5,2,1,3 but both have the same width of 4 nodes.
