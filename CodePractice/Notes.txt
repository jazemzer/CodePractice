Binary Tree 

1) Serialize and deserialize BST
2) We are given a binary tree and we have to print the tree level wise from bottom right to the root.
3) Depth of BST
4) InOrder traversal without recursion
5) Create BST from sorted Array (easy) , sorted Linked List (hard) , DLL (very hard)
6) You have a BST and int value(take it to be variable val). 
You need to print our all possible paths in the BST which sum to val, they may or may not start at the root.
7) Find LCA
8) Find heigt
9) Is given binary tree A complete binary tree
10) find successor / predecessor
